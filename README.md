# CS1332

Decided to rehash my Data Structures knowledge (no pun intended) by working through Georgia Tech CS1332 assignments found online. 
Implemented over the past couple weeks as part of my morning routine. Yeah, that's how I roll!

__HW 1:__ ArrayList - I remember the days when I first met you, ArrayList.

__HW 2:__ Circular Singly-Linked List - It was quite a spin!

__HW 3:__ Stacks & Queues - Taking things to a new level.

__HW 4:__ Binary Search Trees - Searching like there's no tomorrow.

__HW 5:__ MaxHeaps - Maxing out the Heap, the real heapster.

__HW 6:__ HashMaps - Map it like it's hot.

__HW 7:__ AVL Trees - Balance is not something you find, it's something you create.

__HW 8:__ Sorting Algorithms - Playing the sort game.

__HW 9:__ Pattern Matching - Looking for that needle in the haystack.

__HW 10:__ Graph Algorithms - It's all about connections.
